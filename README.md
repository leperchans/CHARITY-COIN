What is S$%#@*(&^!%@$#^*Coin?
----------------

S$%#@*(&^!%@$#^*Coin is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Whilst originally based off the Dash
project, then the Zixx Core, S$%#@*(&^!%@$#^*Coin extended the existing functionality to improve its usability and
used the built in coin block splitting code to create a system that would automatically send 50% of all coins mined to 10
charities all spread out evenly. All the charities had to do was keep the wallet passwords that they created and
decide when to sell that was it. I actually sat down put real thought and effort into this. I thought of a way that
potentially could of satisfied everyone it gave to charity, i figured since it went to charity if miners logged their coins
it created a tax right-off for our government gotta love that. And if the price was pushed up the charities won the people won
there were tax benefits for everyone. Low and behold all needed was a pool. The coin was done it was ready and were not talking
a 40 year plane i ran the numbers it was a 10 year deal a billion coins, it splits did all the things you all like. it got harder it
was neoscrypt to keep the machines at bay.in that process I hand chose 10 charities that had special meaning for me t had the wallets
ready to go. windows , linux , mac. my charities if anyone cares.

UBTA - International Brain Tumor Alliance
Child Fund Ireland
Brain and Behavior Research Foundation
iFRED - Shine a light on Depression
Charity Associates - Ireland
BCRF - Breast Cancer Research Foundation
Dare to Dream Children's Foundation
Fathers4Justice - helping dads stay in their children's lives
The Innocence project
The ISPCAN

cancer, Depression, anxiety. kids, keeping dads involved with kids, not letting good people rot in prison - the things that i believe in.

So coin was done was in talks to get it listed was going to have to give a bit to make it happen but it was worth it. And then some greedy ass people wanted to rob me and steal my shit, and in the process they broke something that actually meant something to me. Unlike most of the old heads around here that claim they are good bullet me tell yuo all something. There are ghost-scripts, hidden code, back doors, subtle misspelling that break dependencies littered in all this "free code" the only way to try and do anything safely is brek down the code type it your self get dependencies from source re create it from scratch on your own if not your going to get fucked. If you have something worth taking they will take it. Coins are loops, loops are persistent. There is no good in this everyone is trying to get rich and yes money is the root of all that is bad in the world.I have not always had a good moral compass, but im not a bad person. I saw a way to actually do some good, and had shit on it was wrong. I asked for help from everywhere. Fucking Theymos banned me 3 times for asking questions I appeal i get nothing, Elephant Man
this dude was to scared to even have an open conversation with me. I knew his peeps were talking to the people who got me, he fucking blew me off. You all are either to big of pussies, Cobra hide behind a screen and some bullshit , resistance, planet x , get the fuck outta here, grow the fuck up kids. They want to push everyone out be some make believe coin illuminati or freemasons, ive seen the ghostscripts you all hide, i know there is a yiimp pool code on github that downloads kali on your system, for what, really i went to the discord i asked i was banned, fuck you too. Im obviously not like you people, ill tell ya my name give ya my
address you can come see me i dont care. Im not one for hiding from behind a screen

ps Cobra dude the dread pirate will be in prison forever, he created a platform that he PROFITTED KNWINGLY FROM to sell illegal goods and favors. He put a HIT out on someone and paid the hit off after recieving "PROOF of DEATH" Life in prison dog that is the price he pays. YOU SPEW IS FUCKING NONSENSE.

which brings me to my final point ole dread made one mistake early early mistake the dude who got me, First im no trained computer dude, im the person most of you all always hated I did what i wanted how i wanted and it just worked out. I could be your friend or honestly if i was some of you people who have been scammed and erobbed, i lost in total about 250k I know of people who have lost more, i COULD BE THE PERSON RINGING YOUR DOORBELLS, DELIVERING YOUR FOOD, THE ONE DRIVING YOUR WOMEN THE ONES YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR, and then sticking rubberband gun in your face : ] .I found my hacker less than 30 days.I have his name i know lots, and i can prove it was him because he made a mistake too. Mr GoodtheBEST lol, he can't even rehack me and get the proof, i have it on a disconnected back up drive, Mr. Hardeep Singh, I warned you dude. Im going here now next time i see you in person

you all need to stay away from this dude

all the same guy and from new dehli, possibly in canada on a student visa i have that visa number and his name coincedently matches that of a terrorist, well a supposed called terrorist who resides in canada. he claims he is a man without a homeland or a homeland he isnt in. He claims to want his hertiage yet he would rather put his own face all over the place while he being a douche bag. I warned him and he knows it gave him plenty of time to just get the fuck out. Told him i would find him he probably laughed until he got the email. want his facebook twitter i got it, 30 days all i needed. one of these days "SWIM" will come along and kick the door in of your mommas houses and they wont come for you, they will put a srubberband gun in her mouth and make you clean out everything you have and then wipe your shit clean. Because theymos cobra, thats gangster and thats how it should be done, in person. If you think for a minute people arent gonna spill everything they know your nuts, those people, the "SWIMs" they do exist. Your lucky in their minds you are still the dorks who got no play in college and high school, one day though someone will catch on be very happy it isnt 2000/2001 i could of been "SWIM". I picked those charities for a reason.

You all may think im nuts but i dont think so.

1. the ghost-coding is real - take a yiimp remove the clears record the screen watch in slow mo read the code it doesnt corilate, its other places scatered throughout all of these git shits
2. the theymos cobra shit google it - are you kidding me you put 2 people that are to big of pussies to even do anything but hide behind a screen. From what i gather theymos pays other people to code 100k a month at that, and cobra he is a mouth a voice, a wanna be cult leader of the digital world. fuck them fuck bitcoin, like Busta said at Coachella throw fruit at these fake ass studio bitches - cause thats who they are you hide behind the screen you are a fake ass studio bitch.
3. what happened to me is real - i asked for help and was shunned and banned - either they are balless or they are all involved - i lost a lot and im going to pay a hefty price for it - BE CAREFUL

AS FOR ME IM GOING TO DO SOME GOOD COINS A FEW DAYS FROM READY I CAN HAVE WALLETS FOR CHARITES MADE AND READY IN 24 HOURS AND DELIVERED OF COURSE. AT WHICH POINT YUOR STEALING FROM ME AND ALL TRHOSE PEOPLE IN
NEED BUT I WANT TO DO SOME GOOD POSSIBLY LOOK BACK AND SMILE GIVE MY KIDS AND WIFE SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF I DID. THE POOL IS ONLINE DONT KNOW HOW TO 100% WORK IT IM GETTING THERE. iLL TAKE EBCRYPTION HELP TO KEEP
IT SAFE ILL TAKE POOL HELP EVEN COIN POINTERS. TO GET MY CODE BEFORE IT IS RELEASED YOU WILL SEND ME REAL INFO, TAKE IT HOW YOU WANT, IM GOING TO DO SOMETHING GOOD WITH THIS GREEDY MONEY MAKING MACHINE THAT WAS
CREATED. ONCE IT IS UP AND RUNNING IT IS GOOD FOR REAL 10 YEARS COINS ARE GONE IF ALL GOES WELL THAT IS $50000000 COINS PER CHARITY AT A DIME &0.10 USD THAT IS $500000.00 USD PER CHARITY, TTHAT IS USING THIS FOR GOOD.


I GUESS THE QUESTION BECOMES WHO WANTS TO BE A BITCH AND GET IN ITS WAY AND WHO WANTS TO USE THIS SHIT FOR SOME REAL GOOD.

information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is meant to be stable. Development is normally done in separate branches.
are created to indicate new official, stable release versions of S$%#@*(&^!%@$#^*Coin
The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](/doc/unit-tests.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`

There are also [regression and integration tests](/qa) of the RPC interface, written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/qa) are installed) with: `qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.py`

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows
and Linux, OS X, and that unit and sanity tests are automatically run.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

Translations
------------

The translation process has to be defined.
